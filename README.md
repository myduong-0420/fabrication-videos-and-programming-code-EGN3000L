# Programming Code
This program makes use of the Arduino Ultrasonic library version 3.0.0, which is a minimalist library that simplifies working with the ultrasound module, and is compatible with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The explanation for each line of code will be implemented in the program as comments. The program starts with installing the Ultrasonic library and defining pin variables. Then, the void setup function is written. After that, the void loop function is established, inside of which there are “instructions” that run over and over for the robot. The motion functions are called at the end so the robot can perform basic movements like turn right, turn left, move forward, move backward, and stop.
